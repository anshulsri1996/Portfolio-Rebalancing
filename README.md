CALENDER BASED REBALANCING TOOL

##Here we take input of 4 ASSET CLASSES = [Gold, Equity, Real Estate, Bonds] with equal initial weightage and create a rebalancing tool where after month end all the weightages are reset to equal once again irrespective of the return given by the asset class.

##We can input the ticker symbol as we wish to change the assets and change the start and end period for which we want to observe the portfolio performance.

##We can also play around with the kind of portfolio weightages we want depending on our risk profile.
